# Coding Challenge - Registration Solution

The registration of pointclouds is carried out in this repository. The transformation required to match the poinclouds is obtained as the output of the main script. Libpointmatcher library is used for processing pointclouds. Paraview is used to visualize pointclouds.

The main script (main.py) is inside the scripts (./scripts) folder of this repository.

Scan data of all the objects are inside the data (./data) folder of this repository.
